<h2>Hobby and interests</h2>
<p>I don't have actually fixed hobby, because I don't have a lot free time. However, I'm willing on programming, but it is part of my study at university, so I think it cannot be hobby.<br>
Before university it was my hobby, so I choose Inha University for discovering new knowledge and becoming professional engineer and programmer. <br>
When I have free time I try to read some blogs and articles, watch useful videos and meaningful movies and serials.
I decided to share with you some of my favorite movies. Click the link below.
